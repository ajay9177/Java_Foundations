//Sealed classes
//A sealed class grants inheritance permission to a specific list of classes
//Every permitted subclass must already exist and must explicitly extend the sealed class
//Every permitted subclass is required to declare itself as sealed, non-sealed, or final


Examples:

public sealed class Shape permits Rectangle,Circle{}
public class Circle extends Shape{}
public class Rectangle extends Shape{}
public sealed class Rectangle extends Shape permits Square{}
public non-sealed class Circle extends shape{}
public final class Square extends Rectangle{}
